## esk8s a.k.a Elastic Stack on K8S

Elastic Stack on K8S - This repository contains the entire workflow for managing a containerized setup of Elastic Stack on a locally running K8S environment. For the purpose of this experiment, I will use Jenkins, Gitlab, Pipelines (for CI/CD) and last, but not the least, a local setup of Minikube.
